# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Integrating GitHub Actions with KHarish15/testing3

This document provides step-by-step instructions for integrating GitHub Actions into your Python project, KHarish15/testing3, for automated testing.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This file will define the actions to be performed.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pushes to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9' # Or your preferred Python version
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
```

**2. Required Environment Variables:**

This project does not require any specific environment variables.

**3. Dependencies:**

The project requires `pytest`.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Pytest):**

Your project likely has a `main.py` file containing the functions and a `test_main.py` file for the tests.  If your tests are not in the `test_main.py` file ensure this `test_main.py` file exists or modify the `run: |` command accordingly.

**5. Viewing Test Results:**

GitHub Actions will display the test results directly in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.  A successful run will show a green check mark, and a failed run will show the errors and failures.  For more detailed information, review the `pytest` output in the run details.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **`pip` issues:** If `pip install pytest` fails, make sure you have a recent version of `pip` installed. The `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` command can help in cases where pip might be outdated.  Verify your internet connection.
* **`pytest` issues:**  If `pytest` does not run or reports errors, ensure the `pytest` command is correctly identifying your test files. Double-check the location and names of your test files. Ensure your tests import the necessary functions from the `main.py` file.  Verify your `assert` statements in `test_*.py` are correct.
* **Python version mismatch:** If you get errors related to Python version, check the Python version specified in the `.github/workflows/test.yml` and ensure that's the version available in the virtual environment.
* **Missing `main.py`:**  Confirm that a `main.py` file exists.  If test files are in a different folder (e.g., `tests/test_main.py`), adjust the `pytest` command accordingly.
* **Incorrect imports:** Verify that `test_main.py` correctly imports functions from `main.py`.  The example provided should be a good starting point.


**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps:**

* **Test File Structure:** If your test files are not in the same directory as `main.py`, adjust the `pytest` command to specify the directory containing your test files.

```yaml
# ... other parts of the workflow
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    pytest tests/  # Or the actual path to your test files
```

**Example `main.py` (to verify your imports):**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# ... other functions
```

**Example `tests/test_main.py`:**

```python
import pytest
from main import add

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

This comprehensive setup should guide you through integrating GitHub Actions for automated testing in your KHarish15/testing3 project. Remember to commit and push these changes to your repository.  The workflow will now automatically run tests on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
